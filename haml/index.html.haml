          You can start a new game at any time by drawing a "+" with your finger on the screen. 
          You will be presented with the new game form where you can select your options.
      %h1 The Players
      %ul.plastic

          First, you

          will be known as "Black" and "White."

      %h2 Rules
      %ul.plastic
        %li
          You pick the rules first. There are lots of games for two players featuring black and white 
          stones on a lattice of intersections, and "Wood and Stones" lets you play lots of them with
          a friend.
      %h2 Size
      %ul.plastic
        %li
          Depending on the rules you choose, you may be offered a choice of board size from 9x9 up to 19x19.
          As a rough guide, larger boards offer more complex and subtle opportunities for play.
      %h2 Setups
      %ul.plastic
        %li
          Depending on the rules you choose, you may be offered a choice of ways to set the board up
          for the game. In some cases, these are fixed positions for one or more stones. These fixed
          positions might be handicaps for Black or they might be initial setups that wildly affect
          the character of the game.
        %li
          In some cases, these are opportunities for Black to have free placements before the game begins. 
          Unlike fixed handicaps, free placements provide Black with an opportunity to dictate the style of
          play.
        %li
          A few setups place stones randomly on the board. This helps to break games free from stereotypical
          opening play and rewards intuition over memorization.

      %h2 Description
      %ul.plastic
        %li
          The "Classic," "Free Placement," and "More Setups" rules are all the commonly played rules of Go.
          They differ only in the setups available. Only the most recently played move is considered for Ko.
          Suicide is not allowed, however if a placement would capture one or more stones, it need not have
          liberties. Wood and Stones does not score games, so it is up o the players how to count the territories.
      %h2 Classic Setups
      %ul.plastic
        %li
          The Classic setups are the traditional handicap options: Either Black plays first, or Black receives
          a handicap of two to nine stones and white plays first. Handicap stones are placed on the Hoshi
          points in the proscribed manner.
      %h2 Free Placement Setups
      %ul.plastic
        %li
          The Free Placement setups also offer Black the choice of playing first or receiving
          a handicap of two to nine stones and white playing first. However, instead of the handicap stones
          being placed on the Hoshi points, Black places them as he pleases. In effect, Back receives free
          turns at the beginning of the game.

        %li
          There are a number of variations of Go that use the exact same rules of play and scoring
          but use special setups. Some&#8212like Wild Fuseki&#8212produce subtly different games. 
          Others&#8212like Dots or Influence&#8212are dramatically unique playing experiences.
      %h2 Pie Rule
      %ul.plastic
        %li
          "Pie Rule" is a variation where Black places a single stone anywhere on the board, and White
          may either place a stone or pass. If White places a stone, the game continues as usual. If
          White passes, the players swap colours and the player who was originally Black now is White
          and places a white stone on the board. Pie Rule provides Black with a disincentive to play 
          too well or too poorly on the first turn, thus creating a very balanced game.
      %h2 Wild and Really Wild Fuseki
      %ul.plastic
        %li
          "Wild Fuseki" is a variation where the first three stones for each player are randomly selected,
          with the proviso that no stones are placed within two rows of any edge, no illegal position
          is created, and no stones are placed in atari. Really Wild Fuseki places the first twelve
          stones for each player. The effect of Wild Fuskeki is to reward intuition over memorization of
          opening patterns.

          Dots Go consists of stones on alternate intersections of the board. Games evolve very differently 
          than standard Go.
      %h2 Sunjang Baduk
      %ul.plastic
        %li
          Sunjang Baduk is an archaic Korean version of Go. There is a prescribed opening position, 
          and the scoring is a little different from Japanese or Chinese go. Even if you don't 
          care to play with different scoring, you might find games with the Sunjang Baduk opening 
          setup a refreshing change of pace.
      %h2 Classical Chinese
      %ul.plastic
        %li
          Classical Chinese Opening go players started each game with two stones each on corner Hoshi 
          points, leading to fighting. Classical Chinese rules were also different, however choosing 
          this option starts a standard game of Go with the Classical Chinese Opening.

          The "White to Live" games all use the standard Go rules for play, however their objective is 
          different. In each game, Black is given an overwhelming advantage and White is hard-pressed
          to survive. White wins if he can make life, i.e. create a safe group with two eyes. Black
          wins instantly if he can remove all the white stones from the board. There are several different
          setups.

      %h2 Free Placements
      %ul.plastic
        %li 
          You can also play where Black is given a large number of free placements and White simply tries to 
          survive. An even game is thought to be seventeen placements on a 19x19 board, however you can 
          choose more or fewer to establish a handicap. You may also choose a smaller board and fewer placements.

          "Atari Go" and "Capture Five" are games that follow the standard rules of Go but have unique victory 
          conditions. In Atari Go, the first player to capture any of the opponent's stones is the winner. In
          Capture Five, the first player to capture five of the opponent's stones is the winner. With careful,
          defensive play by both sides a draw is possible. Atari Go usually teaching exercises, with
          each setup teaching a particular aspect of offensive play. The student plays black and the teacher
          plays white.
